def lacey_mixing_curve(time, k, tau, m0):
    """Curve for the Lacey mixing model.

    The Lacey mixing model is a exponential model that describes the 
    mixing of a binary system. The model is classically defined as [1] 
    [2]:

    .. math:: 
    
        M(t) = 1 - (1 - M_0) e^{-kt}

    where :math:`M(t)` is the Lacey mixing index at time :math:`t`, 
    :math:`M_0` is the initial Lacey Mixing index, :math:`k` is the 
    mixing rate constant, and :math:`t` is the time.

    An extension of the Lacey mixing model to include a time constant
    :math:`\\tau` to allow for delayed onset of exponential mixing 
    mixing behavior was proposed by Ratnayake et al. [2]:

    .. math::

        M(t) = max(1 - (1 - M_0) e^{-k(t - \\tau)})

    This mixing model is used to fit the mixing data as with no delayed
    onset of exponential mixing Ratnayake et al.'s model reduces to the
    classical Lacey mixing model.
